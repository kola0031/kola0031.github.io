Some of the images used were sourced from unsplash.com. I also used images from my own photography portfolio. 
Twitter, instagram and google maps iframe embed generated some errors in the code. I hope this does not count against me. 
Bootstrap was used and I tried to customize it. Hopefully, its not so obvious. 
Mockups are also attached in the assignment shell
Thanks professor for teaching me a valuable lesson on media queries and css grids. I learnt the hard way after trying to use bootstrap as shortcut. 
Hopefully, we have you next semester.
